## Detailed Totem guide
This is for when the Totems Explode starting from the bottom to the top.
![a more detailed N/NW guide (for bottom up)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/905922390964461628/928495721911582750/unknown.png)
Essentially:
 - 1 goes NW -> N -> N
 - 2 goes N -> S -> NW
 - everyone else resolves normally (back to clock positions but go N or S to resolve buff if needed)
for top to bottom, it will be similar, but:
 - 1 goes NW -> S -> N
 - 2 stays N -> N -> NW
